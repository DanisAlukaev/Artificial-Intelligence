This archive contains 1 docx file with the report, 1 README file and 9 source files with the implementation of the backtracking search algorithm and A-star search algorithm on the prolog.
The test function (rule) is located and available in the file test.pl. There you can specify the size of grid and choose the method of map generation.
By default there are used 9Ã—9 grid size and random generation of the map. One can also choose one the prepared maps or set the positions of covids, mask, doctor and home directly 
in the rule set_map(). Following instructions on how to set up the environment are written in the comments to the code in the file test.pl

In order to run the code, download the SWI-Prolog from the official web-site https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable
Following instructions will be performed via command line interface (CLI):

Go to the CLI of SWI Prolog:
	>  swipl

Connect the source file:
	?- ['/absolute/path/to/file/test.pl'].

Run the test function (rule):
	?- test().
