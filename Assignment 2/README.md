## The genetic algorithm for art.
Work is in progress.

### Getting started:
In order to run the genetic algorithm use 
```python main.py```

### To-Do list:
1. Optimize image generation from list of symbols. 
2. Apply OOP design to the code.
3. Implement the genetic algorithm flow based on this [specification](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3).
